# melody-maker
This program outputs a MIDI file for a 2 bar "melody" that is randomly generated by selecting rhythms patterns and interval sequences. I see this program as a proof of concept for a much more complex program - I am interested in exploring how I could use machine learning to generate new melodies based on the rhythm patterns and interval sequences of existing melodies. The music generated by this program tends to sound "un-musical" due to it's random nature - the "rules" of music are far too complicated to be programmed by a human.

## **How to Use:**

Simply run main.py and play/open the MIDI file using another application e.g. VLC or MuseScore

## **Running the Code:**

The only dependency for this program is [MIDIUtil](https://github.com/MarkCWirt/MIDIUtil)
Install with `pip install MIDIUtil`

## **Known Problems:**

Some combinations of rhythms patterns and interval sequences will lead to trying to add really high or really low notes that are out of the bounds of the CMajor array (i.e. they don't exist in the MIDI specification).
